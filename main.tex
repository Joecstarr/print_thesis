\begin{acknowledgments}
  Completing this PhD has been the hardest thing I've ever done. The
  last four years were filled with stress, doubt, and exhaustion. I
  would have never been able to tackle this alone. I feel grateful to
  have had a team around me and supported me through each milestone.

  I want to express my deepest thanks to my best friend and wife
  Valeria, who has been with me at every step. She sacrificed so much
  to make this happen. She moved across the country away from family,
  worked as our primary bread winner, ate way too many frozen dinners
  when I just couldn't do more that day, missed out on four years of
  vacations, and just felt every ounce of my stress and exhaustion.
  Valeria, te amo, I'm happy to have you as my partner, you're my
  rock. I also need to acknowledge what kept Valeria and I from
  losing it when the stress maxed out, Topper the pug, the best dog
  in the world. Thank you for sitting with (on) me for hours on end
  while I studied for qualifying exams, prepared for my comprehensive
  exam, prepared for my defense, and wrote this thesis.

  To my family, you've all been there for me. Mom and Dad, I'm
  grateful that you have always pushed me to do hard things and
  supported me through all my successes and failures. Mom, thank you
  for walking this path before me, I truly don't understand how you
  had two children while completing a PhD. I'm grateful for all the
  conversations and advice you've given me and for always reassuring
  me that it's normal and will be okay. Dad, thank you for everything
  you've done for us. Thank you for helping us move, for driving to
  Iowa to be here while I worked through exam weeks, for helping us
  with the garden, and for so many other things. To my siblings,
  thank you for being fun and keeping my spirits up. To Aunt Shirley,
  thank you for being in my corner. To my in-laws Gume and Marisol,
  thank you for all you've done for Valeria, I couldn't ask for
  better people to be my in-laws.

  School hasn't always been easy for me; as a child I experienced an
  environment where faculty were cruel. Moving beyond that experience
  has been hard, but I've been lucky to have had a wonderful
  collection of mentors and friends to help me. My high school
  physics teacher, Dr. Deano Smith, thank you for believing in me. My
  high school biology teachers, Martha and Tom Friedlander, thank you
  for always encouraging me. My math professor, Dr. Alan Wiggins,
  thank you for putting The Knot Book
  \citep{adamsKnotBookElementary2004} in my hands and showing me that
  I can do math. My computer science professor, Dr. Bruce Elenbogen,
  thank you for challenging me; you are missed.

  I would like to also thank the community I've built and been
  accepted into at Iowa and in the broader math community. To my
  advisor Isabel Darcy, thank you for all you've done for me in the
  last few years. Thank you for bringing me into your community and
  being one of my biggest cheerleaders and advocates. I look forward
  to our continued collaboration and hope we build great things. To
  my committee members, Francis Bonahon, Keiko Kawamuro, Colleen
  Mitchell, and Radmila Sazdanovic thank you for serving on my
  committee and for all the time you've given me as I've matured as a
  mathematician. To the Iowa Topology group, without the support of
  the RTG (DMS-2038103), I would never have had the opportunity to
  meet Dr. Bonahon and Dr. Sazdanovic. To my academic siblings and
  extended applied topology friends; Ethan, George, Jacob, Paria, and
  Robert, thanks for all the brainstorming and good conversation. To
  Nick Connolly, ``The Tanglenomicon''
  \citep{connollyClassificationTabulation2string2021} is an amazing name for the
  series of Iowa applied topology tanlge tabulation projects, I'm excited to add
  my subtile to this collection. To the
  ISA, particularly Lori Adams, thank you for helping me develop
  as an instructor and giving me a venue to express myself. The Iowa
  community is full of wonderful people, unfortunately I can't thank
  everyone individually, so to those who I havn't listed I simply thank
  you for being you.

  Finally, It may seem strange, but I would like to also acknowledge
  my 2019 fusion. Over my four years in Iowa, my car safely carried
  me as I drove around 1000 hours of commute.

\begin{abstract}
  The enumeration of provably unique mathematical knots, tabulation, has been a
  core area of research for over 150 years. One important advancement
  in this area
  was Conway's development of a building block for knots, the tangles. Formally,
  an $n$-string tangle is a portion of a knot diagram enclosed in a Jordan curve
  that intersects the knot in exactly $2n$ points. The tabulation of the two
  string tangles, Conway's building blocks for knots, has been called:

    ``The most important missing infrastructure project in knot
    theory'' -Dr. Dror
    Bar-Natan\citep{bar-natanMostImportantMissing}
  \end{quote}
  \vspace{-2mm}
  Without such a table of tangles, researchers are in the
  position of a chemist who possesses a table of fatty acids but no periodic
  table. In this thesis we answer, in part, this call.

  This thesis develops the theory needed to
  tabulate tables of successively more complex classes of tangles. We start with
  the rational and Montesinos tangles, and then conclude with the arborescent
  tangles, often called the algebraic tangles. For each of
  these classes of
  tangles, we additionally develop a collection of software designs used to
  efficiently and scalably compute tables of these tangles to high crossing
  number (19). We will also
  discuss ways that the accessibility of knot theory and in
  particular tabulation make the domain a candidate for undergraduate
  research. As
  part of our discussion of undergraduate research, we will outline a software
  engineering process particularly suited for undergraduate research in knot
  theory, as well as a model life cycle for an undergraduate research experience
  in computational knot theory.

  The tabulation, creation of a list, of mathematical
  knots has been a core area of mathematics research for over 150 years. A key
  breakthrough in knot tabulation was Conway's development of a
  building block for
  knots, the two string tangle. A two string tangle is a portion of a
  mathematical knot bound within a ball and intersecting that
  ball in exactly
  four points. A table of these objects has been called:
  \begin{quote}
    ``The most important missing infrastructure project in knot
    theory'' -Dr. Dror
    Bar-Natan\citep{bar-natanMostImportantMissing}
  \end{quote}
  \vspace{-2mm}
  Without such a table of tangles, mathematicians and scientists are in the
  position of a chemist who possesses a table of fatty acids but no periodic
  table. In this thesis we answer, in part, this call.

  As we progress through this thesis, we produce
  successively larger and more complete tables of tangles. Each table we produce
  requires the development of the mathematical theory demonstrating that what we
  have produced is what we say it is. Then, for each tangle type we develop the
  theory for, we also develop a collection of software designs used
  to convince a
  computer to quickly generate large tables of tangles. We will also
  discuss ways that the accessibility of knot theory and in
  particular tabulation make this domain a candidate for undergraduate
  research. As
  part of our discussion of undergraduate research, we will outline a software
  engineering process particularly suited for undergraduate research in knot
  theory, as well as a model life cycle for an undergraduate research experience
  in computational knot theory.
